## Content-Editable

Content Editable is a simple in-editor text area with some local storage for quick access to notes. 
Check it out at http://markgandolfo.github.com/editable/

### How does it work?
As you type it'll store your text in local storage. Everyone starts with a "scratch" pad they can quickly jot notes down onto, but the ability to add different notes/tabs are available. 

## What's to come?
At the moment, your notes will be stored locally against the domain of content-editable (at the moment it's the github domain), but I'd like to introduce dropbox sync using their api so you can move around and have the same set of notes no matter which computer you're on. 

And possibly a really simple, bold, italic, bullet points wysiwyg.
